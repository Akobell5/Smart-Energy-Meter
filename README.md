# Smart-Energy-Meter
This repo contains a full project of smart energy meters using Python (Raspberry PI) or Micropython (ESP32). A PDF is also attached to it to further explain the calculation that was implemented in the code and also the hardware circuit diagram. 
This project can be used to capture and save real-time data when modified which can be used to train machine-learning based energy meters. Feel free to modify the code and in case of any questions, you can reach out.
